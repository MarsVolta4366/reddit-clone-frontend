I got inspired to build a Reddit clone because I thought it would be great way to practice and expand my abilities as a full stack developer. I wanted to build something that I could put on my portfolio to demonstrate some of what I'm capable of regarding full stack development, RESTful APIs, authentication, and more.

## Technologies used
This website was built using React, Node, Express, Sequelize, Material UI, Luxon, Postgres, Sass, Heroku, and Netlify.
## Bugs
* Text opactiy styling is applied on all post items regardless of size
* Create a post form is visible to non logged in users but doesn't actually submit posts unless logged in
* Cookie session isn't working when using the site on mobile
* useEffect should probably only exist in App.js to prevent rerendering when show post page is closed, currently when you close a show post page, it rerenders and scrolls you back to the top of the page which isn't ideal
## Unfinished functionality
I'd like to implement a feature where when creating a post, you can search for the community you want to post to. Right now the community submission is just a text box so it's difficult to tell if you're submitting to the correct community. I'd like to add the ability to submit a post with images and videos. I'd also like to make the search bar work.
